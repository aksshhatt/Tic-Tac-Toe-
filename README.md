Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple, yet fun, Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a classic 2-player game where you and a friend take turns placing your marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid. The first player to line up three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

Features:
1. 2-Player Mode: Challenge a friend on the same device.
2. Winning Logic: The game automatically detects when someone wins by forming a line of three marks.
3. Draw Detection: If all squares are filled with no winner, the game will declare a draw.
4. Stylish Interface: Enjoy a responsive design with interactive buttons and a vibrant background.
5. Flashing and Zoom Effects: Watch the winning player’s mark flash, along with a zoom-in effect on the victory image for some extra flair.
6. Responsive Design: Optimized to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3 (with beautiful animations and gradients)
3. JavaScript (for all the interactive game logic)
